* **What's Geekometer?**

 Geekometer is an add-on to help the user practice questions on Geeksforgeeks more efficiently. Geeksforgeeks, having an excellent question corpus for coding interview preparation, has a huge bunch of question links which might make it difficult for some users to track the topics they have done and prioritize topics. Geekometer helps to keep this track wherein a user can mark topics as "Done", "Prioritize" - based on different color schemes and "Prioritize and mark done"!

	Its fairly simple!

* First look at the original geeksforgeeks interface - No organised questions!
Now go to a question link. Done with the question? Mark is as "Done"!. Want to rank it or prioritize for solving later? Set the "Priority level" - use and color from available three color scheme!
